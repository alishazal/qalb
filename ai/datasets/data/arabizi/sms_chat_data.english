Hey Brett, sorry I didn't get to see you and Sarah, I was staying with people and was kind of at the mercy of their schedule cuz I had no wheels. However, I think I will be back in June to visit my girlfriends grandfather in Laguna beach in June. You Sarah and the baby should come down and spend a day on the beach with us if I end up doing that. Hope you are able to get a little sleep and your little one is happy and healthy.
I definitely believe you can;)

And then, once you meet the little and you see what it feels like to be parents you can have done clout when grandparents are trying to shove words of wisdom down your throats.
It's horseback riding except the horse just kind of prances slowly in a circle. You get judged on fanciness and you're disqualified if your family is new money.

Yes she had glasses but they are very ugly. I bought the cheapest ones possible to wear at home. I think she will be very upset if we tell her to go without lenses. Yesterday she was extremely unhappy counting all the 'things' she has been losing recently. Family, extended family, her money, her dream university etc...I think losing her contacts for 6 weeks will be too much to ask of her.
Yeah the time for that is lame, but flights aren't that expensive, idk. I'd be down to save up and buy half your ticket. Hah im not perfect by any means.
I want to go to bed soon so the sooner the better

I mean the situation is complex on a lot of levels, and that's not in your control. There's no easy way to navigate it. But try not to see the situation as a failure if people react negatively. Your priority shouldn't be keeping people happy but working towards everyones best interest including your own.
BUT RAIN
