    <h3>Introduction</h3> 

    
<p>BOLT English SMS/Chat, Linguistic 
  Data Consortium (LDC) catalog number LDC2018T19 and ISBN 1-58563-856-0, was 
  developed by LDC and consists of naturally-occurring Short
Message Service (SMS) and Chat (CHT) data collected through data donations
and live collection involving native speakers of English. The corpus contains 18,429 conversations totaling 3,674,802 words across
375,967 messages.</p>
  
  <p>The   <a href = "https://www.ldc.upenn.edu/collaborations/current-projects/bolt">BOLT</a> (Broad Operational Language Translation) program developed machine translation and information retrieval for less formal genres, focusing particularly on user-generated content. LDC supported the BOLT program by collecting informal data sources -- discussion forums, text messaging and chat -- in Chinese, Egyptian Arabic and English. The collected data was translated and annotated for various tasks including word alignment, treebanking, propbanking and co-reference. </p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>The data in this release was collected using two methods: new collection via
LDC's collection platform, and donation of SMS or chat archives from BOLT
collection participants.  All data collected were reviewed manually to exclude
any messages/conversations that were not in the target language or that had
sensitive content, such as personal identifying information (PII). All data is presented in UTF-8 XML.</p>
